## 🧠 FAQs

**Q: Why does selecting "Windows" matter in support tickets?**  
A: The ticket system only allows dropdown OS fields. By selecting Windows and clarifying Linux use via emulation, we highlight the forced workaround.

**Q: Isn’t Linux support a small market?**  
A: Linux users include developers, educators, and community contributors—people who help grow the ecosystem and actively support the physical TCG.

**Q: Is Linux support actually possible?**  
A: Yes. Unity supports Linux builds natively. Proton packaging requires minor effort. Flatpak compatibility is also achievable.
